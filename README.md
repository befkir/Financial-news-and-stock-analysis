Stock Data Analysis: Performs technical analysis on stock data using indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD.

Correlation Analysis Between News Sentiment and Stock Prices: Aligns news and stock price data by dates to analyze sentiment's impact on stock returns.

### 📈 Results
The analysis yielded the following insights:
GitHub

Sentiment Distribution: The majority of news articles exhibit neutral sentiment, with fewer articles showing strong positive or negative sentiment.

Technical Indicators: Indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and MACD provided insights into stock trends and potential trading signals.

Correlation Analysis: A weak positive correlation was observed between news sentiment and stock closing prices, suggesting that while sentiment has some effect, it is not the primary driver of stock price movements.
